# Daily-To-Do

Welcome to your work day agenda planner. The reason for the program was to create a
dynamic scheduler that utilizes a little bit of everything. The page layout was created
using bootstrap, the style thru css, the time thru moment.js and a little bit of jquery
to seal the deal. The program uses color coded blocks to determine where you currently
are in your work day. The red blocks indicate the "right now", the green blocks are
the hours to come and the grey blocks represent hours past. Each entry can be saved in
the browsers local storage so there is no need to retrieve anything from a server. Hope
you enjoy planning out your busy schedule.
